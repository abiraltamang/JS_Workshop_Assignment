// Task 5: Explore what is dynamically typed language, and why is js a dynamically typed language.

// Dynamically typed language is the programming language if its majority of type checking is  performed at run-time(as opposed to compile time).  In dynamic typing, types are associated with values not variables. Dynamically typed languages include JavaScript,Objective-C, PHP, Prolog, Python, Ruby,etc.

// Js is dynamic typed language because it doesn't require the explicit declaration of the variables before they are used. We can create varibles at runtime, and the type of variable is determined at runtime.
